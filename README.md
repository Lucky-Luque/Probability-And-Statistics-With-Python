## Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings

In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page, suggesting that Fandango inflates the ratings under the hood.

In this project, I will analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

## Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In

For this project I will imagine I am working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement.

The goal of this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in using the freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey dataset. freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication, their survey attracted new coders with varying interests, which is ideal for the purpose of this analysis.
